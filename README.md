# IT-Dev-Final
This repository contains my final project from my first semester Object Oriented programming class. 
A mere console app at first glance, but I'm pretty proud of the AI logic I came up with. The full file directory is included, as well as the game executable. I worked really hard on this, and after the semester was over I knew I would love to continue writing software.
