# IT-Dev-Final
This repository contains my final project from my first semester Object Oriented programming class. 
A mere console app at first glance, but I'm pretty proud of the AI logic I came up with. The full file directory is included, as well as the game executable. Created in Visual Studio using .net framework. I worked really hard on this, and after the semester was over I knew I would love to continue writing software. I continued to learn C# for another semester following the creation of this app, and can provide additional works on request, but I felt this was a good taste of what I can learn in 3 months.
This Repository is free to use and share.
